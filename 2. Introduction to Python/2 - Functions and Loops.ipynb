    "# 2 - Functions and Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on making it to lesson two! Hopefully now you have a basic understanding of what Python is, and some of the data structures we can use. Before we begin this week's lesson, here's a quick recap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables places where we can store values. You can think of a variable as being like a box with a name in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/variable.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we assign a variable by using the equals (`=`) sign. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 'hello!'\n",
    "c = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To check what's inside the variable, we can print it out\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "print(b)\n",
    "print(c)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, anything which follows a hashtag (`#`) is ignored. This is called a comment and is useful for describing what the code is doing\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# this will just be ignored :'(\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many possible types of data we can deal with in Python. Last week we looked at three basic ones: numbers, strings and lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 5            # this is a number\n",
    "b = 'hello!'     # this is a string\n",
    "c = [1, 2, 3]    # this is a list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Maths\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with numbers, we can do all the usual maths operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 10\n",
    "print(a + b)    # addition\n",
    "print(a * b)    # multiplication\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are a special type in Python because they contain other things. We can access individual items by using square brackets. But remember, the items start from zero!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "         #   0        1     2    3      4\n",
    "my_list = ['dog', 'turkey', 65, 100, 'parrot']\n",
    "print(my_list[0])     # this will print 'item 0'\n",
    "print(my_list[3])     # this will print 100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also override individual items\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "my_list[0] = 100\n",
    "# now the list is [100, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add a new item onto the end of the list by using the key word 'append'. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list3 = [5, 'sheep', 17]\n",
    "my_list3.append('fish')\n",
    "# now the list is [5, 'sheep', 17, 'fish']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In python there are some special things we can do on lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list4 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "len(my_list4)    # the tells me the length of the list\n",
    "sum(my_list4)    # this adds the list up. But they must all be numbers!\n",
    "max(my_list4)    # this tells me the biggest number in a list\n",
    "min(mu_list4)    # this tells me the smallest number in a list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, we often want to decide whether or not to do something. For this, we use the key words \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if\n",
    "```\n",
    "and \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "else\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "like this \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 100\n",
    "b = 200\n",
    "\n",
    "if a > b:\n",
    "    print('100 is greater than 200???')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('phew, maths still exists')\n",

    "# New Topic: Functions!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now move on to a new topic: functions. Functions are one of the most important things in programming and you will find them in every language. You can think of a function as a machine that takes something in, and produces something new\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/function.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could take in a number and output that number squared. Or we could take in a list, and output that list in reversed order. There are many many possibilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to make a function in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**. In Python, we create a new function by using the keyword \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "def\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which is short for *define*. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**. Next, we have to give our function a name. Just like with variables, this name can be anything you like\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def squared\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**. Now we need to tell the function what to expect as an input. In this example our function will take in one thing, which we will call `x`. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def squared(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**. Now we need to decide what the function does to that input. Like with conditions, we have to put a colon (`:`) and a tab (four spaces). Then we say what goes on inside our machine. This will be normal code. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def squared(x):\n",
    "    y = x * x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 5**. Finally, we tell our machine what to output by using the keyword \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So our whole function reads\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def squared(x):\n",
    "    y = x * x\n",
    "    return y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 6**. We can now use that function as many times as we like, anywhere in our code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = squared(5)\n",
    "print(a)    # this will print 25\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Look carefully at the function called `squared` you have just written. Now, try writing a new function called `add_one`. This function will look very similar, but instead of returning `x` squared, this time make it return the number *plus one*. Write your code below and test it. "

    "\n",
